# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

In the architecture field, there are Requirements, Risks, Assumptions and Connstrains (RRAC).

## Requirement: 

A requirement is something that a project must acheive at the end. A good architecture meets the requirements. A properly framed requirement must be measureable, i.e it must be -

- Verifiable
- Monitorable
- Traceable
- Feasible

## Risks, Assumptions & Contrains
They determine what a requirement can or cannot be.

Risks can prevent the project from being successful (must be mitigated)
- SPoFs
- User commitment
- Late Delivery

Assumptions are factors held as true for the planning & implementation phases
- Sufficient network bandwith
- Stakeholders will be available to make decisions
- Budget is approved.

Contraints are policy or technical limitations for the project
- Time
- Budget
- Vendor Selection

## From gathering the RRACs, you then create your designs:

### Conceptual Design (napkin)
- Created  by business stakeholders and architects
- Organizes and defindes concepts and rules
- "Napkin Design"

### Logical Design
- Defines how the system should be implemented
- Environment without actual names or sizes
- Example: undeployed CFT

### Physical Design
- Representation of the actual thing that was built
- IP Addresses, ECS instances

PS: I was unable to add more line to the logical diagram as Lucidcharts sent a pop up that I am out of shapes for this document.
